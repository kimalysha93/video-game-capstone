## Introduction

- This Capstone Project was completed as part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate by coursera](https://coursera.org/share/e72350172452259871d67536619cda19)
- The purpose is to use the skills acquired from the Data Analytics course to gain practice experience in analyzing real-life data
- I chose to explore a personal interest of mine: Video Games
- **This data is being used for a hypothetical scenario created for the purpose of this practice project**

## In this Github Project

The folder for [capstone_spreadsheets_sql_slideshow](capstone_spreadsheets_sql_slideshow) includes all the work done with Google Sheets (spreadsheets), BigQuery (SQL), and Google Slides (slideshow). See the [MD file](capstone_spreadsheets_sql_slideshow\README.md) for a detailed documentation of the processes I followed in these three programs.
